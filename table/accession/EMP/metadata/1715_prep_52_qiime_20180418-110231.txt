Three 10 x 10 m plots were set up in each plantation, and three soil cores (20 cm depth) were obtained from random points within them.  Densiometry measurements were made at dbh level, and all trees with canopies overlapping with the plot were identified.  Plantation owners were surveyed for the land use history and soil treatments.
