632.Tar.sand.1	TACTACGTGGCC	GTGTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA	U Waterloo	Canadian MetaMicroBiome Initiative	In an effort to enable the sharing of genetic material from environmental samples for the benefit of the scientific community, we are establishing the Canadian MetaMicroBiome Library. This repository will house composite soil samples that are characterized by extensive 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome sequencing, generating taxonomic profiles and metabolic pathway reconstructions for each sample. The sequence data will be submitted to existing public databases and linked with detailed physical, chemical and geographic characterization of the samples according to established metagenomic standards. Sample DNA will be used to construct high quality libraries in cosmid vectors, allowing for phenotypic screening in a broad range of microbial surrogate hosts. Phenotypic screening of metagenomic libraries provides access to truly novel functions that would otherwise be missed by sequence-based surveys of bulk community DNA or metagenomic libraries. MetaMicroBiome is being initiated with soil samples collected from across Canada, and initial libraries are being screened for novel glycoside hydrolase activities in multiple surrogate hosts. Once MetaMicroBiome is established, contributions of samples from other environments will be accepted for inclusion. The resulting resource will provide the international scientific community with access to a common collection of thoroughly characterized community-contributed genetic material in clone library format for custom phenotypic screen	HiSeq	Illumina HiSeq 2000	EMP V4 515f,806rbc protocol	GT	FWD:GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA; REV:GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT	Illumina	CCME	9/1/11	s_3_1_sequences	.1,g	LBNL	sequencing by synthesis	16S rRNA	V4	73	0.0	4TS	Not applicable	GAZ:Canada	Not applicable	0-0.1	0.05	TRUE	231	231	True	EMP sample	Free-living	Non-saline	Soil (non-saline)	temperate mixed forest biome	oil contaminated soil	soil	soil	biome	terrestrial biome	forest biome	mixed forest biome	temperate mixed forest biome	Not applicable	TRUE	Canada:Alberta	4TS	57.08	57.08	Alberta	-111.54	-111.54	7.6	Standard saturated paste method	U Waterlooo	FALSE	TRUE	Free-living	Non-saline	Soil (non-saline)	632	soil metagenome	410658	soil	soil metagenome	tar sand	Loam	Pipette method	Canadian MetaMicroBiome Initiative	21.1	Combustion method	Combustion method	1.1	12.9	tar sand	40.71	ISBN 873718623	Tar sand 1, Alberta

632.Temperate.rain.forest	GGCCAGTTCCTA	GTGTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA	U Waterloo	Canadian MetaMicroBiome Initiative	In an effort to enable the sharing of genetic material from environmental samples for the benefit of the scientific community, we are establishing the Canadian MetaMicroBiome Library. This repository will house composite soil samples that are characterized by extensive 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome sequencing, generating taxonomic profiles and metabolic pathway reconstructions for each sample. The sequence data will be submitted to existing public databases and linked with detailed physical, chemical and geographic characterization of the samples according to established metagenomic standards. Sample DNA will be used to construct high quality libraries in cosmid vectors, allowing for phenotypic screening in a broad range of microbial surrogate hosts. Phenotypic screening of metagenomic libraries provides access to truly novel functions that would otherwise be missed by sequence-based surveys of bulk community DNA or metagenomic libraries. MetaMicroBiome is being initiated with soil samples collected from across Canada, and initial libraries are being screened for novel glycoside hydrolase activities in multiple surrogate hosts. Once MetaMicroBiome is established, contributions of samples from other environments will be accepted for inclusion. The resulting resource will provide the international scientific community with access to a common collection of thoroughly characterized community-contributed genetic material in clone library format for custom phenotypic screen	HiSeq	Illumina HiSeq 2000	EMP V4 515f,806rbc protocol	GT	FWD:GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA; REV:GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT	Illumina	CCME	9/1/11	s_3_1_sequences	.1,g	LBNL	sequencing by synthesis	16S rRNA	V4	73	0.0	7TR	Not applicable	GAZ:Canada	Not applicable	0-0.1	0.05	TRUE	62	62	True	EMP sample	Free-living	Non-saline	Soil (non-saline)	temperate mixed forest biome	forest soil	soil	soil	biome	terrestrial biome	forest biome	mixed forest biome	temperate mixed forest biome	Not applicable	TRUE	Canada:British Columbia	7TR	48.61	48.61	British Columbia	-124.23	-124.23	4.9	Standard saturated paste method	U Waterlooo	FALSE	TRUE	Free-living	Non-saline	Soil (non-saline)	632	soil metagenome	410658	soil	soil metagenome	temperate rain forest soil	Coarse sandy loam	Pipette method	Canadian MetaMicroBiome Initiative	108	Combustion method	Combustion method	3.5	108	temperate rain forest soil	69.79	ISBN 873718623	Temperate rain forest, British Columbia
